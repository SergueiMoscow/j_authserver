Instructions for go to production

a) Front-end: it is necessary to set up .env and .env.local

b) Back-end: 
- see changes in middleware
- compile: CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o goapps ./cmd/api

c) Database:
pg_dump --no-owner -h localhost -p 5432 -Ujpassano autserver > autserver.sql

It is necessary only to copy the front end, go.apps, go.sum and autserver.sql

On the server:
./goapps -dsn='host=localhost port=5432 user=jpassano password=jP1732 dbname=autserver sslmode=disable' \
-jwt-secret='verysecret' -jwt-issuer='learn-code-ca' -jwt-audience='learn-code-ca' -cookie-domain='learn-code.ca'

sudo lsof -i :8080

It is necessary a conf file with autserver program, perhaps installing supervisor or something like this. It seems
that github with my present apache-Centos server works good.
